# CSS Plugin
The "CSS Plugin" plugin currently only applies some minor, global, default styling options.


## Files and folders
`theme/theme_acs.css`: Some very basic default CSS styling.


## Plugin Configuration
All configuration and integration of the plugin into Papyrus/Eclipse happens in the plugin.xml-file. 

The plugin-file contains a single "extension" that registers the `theme/theme_acs.css`-file as a theme.


## Dependencies
This plugin depends on no other ACS plugins.
